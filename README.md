# Temperature Control App

This repository contains a temperature control app built using React and Redux. The app allows users to set a target temperature and view the current temperature and status of a hypothetical heating system.

## Getting Started

To use the app, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The app can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The app displays the current temperature and the target temperature.
- The app allows users to set the target temperature using a slider.
- The app includes buttons to turn the heating system on or off and to reset the temperature to the default value.
- The app updates the current temperature based on the status of the heating system and the difference between the current and target temperatures.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the app such as:

- The ability for users to save and load multiple temperature settings.
- The ability to customize the appearance of the app, including the color and font.
- The ability to track the temperature history and view it in a graph.
